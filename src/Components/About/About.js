                    <p className="article-p">I have been taking care of dogs since a kid. I was raised with German Shepherds, boxers and mutts. Besides dogs I would always have some other animals like rabbits, hamsters, rats. I used to attend dog training to level up some obedience skills and got passionate about dog sports with my friend's border collie. I gained some professional experience with dog sitting in England, Poland and Germany.</p> 
                        <p className="article-p">Currently, me and my husband are living in a house in West South Austin (Lake Travis/Lakeway area) with a big backyard surrounded by nature, a lovely neighborhood to walk around and direct access to the Colorado River. Unfortunately he is allergic to cats so we cannot host any of them in our house, but I am willing to take care of them in the owner's house if there would be such a need. Due to covid, I am working from home, so your pets will be supervised and receive the best stay (lots of snuggles)</p>
